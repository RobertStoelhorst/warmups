  <h1>Warmup - Raindrops</h1>
  <p>Write a Javascript program that will take a number (eg 28 or 1755 or 9, etc) and output the following:
  </p>
  <p>If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'. If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'. If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'. If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, output the number as a string.
  </p>
  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p>28 has 7 as a factor. In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong". 1755 has 3 and 5 as factors. In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang". 34 has neither 3, 5 nor 7 as a factor. Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that, so it just goes with the straightforward "34".
