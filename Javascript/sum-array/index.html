        <h1>Sum of arrays</h1>
        <p>Write a function that receives two arguments, 
           both of which are Arrays and sums them. 
           These arrays contain only numbers. You don't know their 
           length and they can contain both integers and floating point 
           numbers.</p>
           <h2>Example</h2>
           <p>[2, 6.4, 3] + [3, 3.6, 2] = 20 sum([2, 6.4, 3], [3, 3.6, 2]) => 20</p>
